# ðŸŽ“ Welcome to the **Kotlin Guide**!

Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language developed by **JetBrains**.  
It officially became **Google's preferred language** for Android development in 2019,
signaling a major shift in the Android ecosystem.
This guide will help you understand why Kotlin has gained such popularity and how you can leverage its power.

- **Concise**: Greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate code.
- **Null Safety**: The type system aims to eliminate `NullPointerExceptions`.
- **Interoperable**: Fully compatible with Java and its libraries.
- **Coroutines**: Simplifies asynchronous programming.
- **Multiplatform**: Kotlin can be used for more than just Android!
    - Server-side development (e.g., with Ktor)
    - Web front-end (Kotlin/JS)
    - iOS (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile - KMM)
